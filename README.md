Linear regression is a statistical method for modeling the linear relationship between a dependent variable y and one or more independent variables x. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fit line that can explain the relationship between x and y.

How to Implement Linear Regression
To implement linear regression, you need to follow these steps:

Collect and preprocess the data: Collect the data and preprocess it by cleaning, transforming, and scaling it as necessary. Split the data into training and test sets.

Choose the appropriate model: Decide whether to use simple linear regression or multiple linear regression, depending on the number of independent variables.

Train the model: Train the model on the training data by estimating the values of the coefficients β₀, β₁, β₂, ..., βₙ that minimize the sum of squared errors.

Evaluate the model: Evaluate the performance of the model on the test data by calculating various metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, R² score, etc.

Optimize the model: If the model performance is not satisfactory, you can try various techniques to optimize the model, such as regularization, feature selection, feature engineering, etc.
